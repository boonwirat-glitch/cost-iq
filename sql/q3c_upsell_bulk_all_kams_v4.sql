-- Q3C Upsell Bulk ALL KAMs — v4
-- v4: Remove new_gmv and comeback_gmv columns (dead fields not used by app)
--   → reduces CSV file size ~22% (7 cols instead of 9)
--   → app parser updated to match (02_data_pipeline.js v4)
-- v3 fix retained: KAM→account mapping ใช้ logic เดียวกับ Q8E
--
-- Columns (7): kam_email, account_id, outlet_id, month_label, group_key,
--              existing_gmv, total_gmv
